# Comparative Evaluation of Classification Algorithms for Optimal Model Selection
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project presents a comparative study of various classification algorithms to identify the most effective model for a supervised learning task. The goal is to evaluate multiple machine learning models based on their training and testing performance, and to select the most suitable one for real-world deployment.

By analyzing key metrics like accuracy, precision, and generalization ability, the project ensures a robust, data-driven approach to optimal model selection. Ultimately, the **Random Forest Classifier** was selected as the final model due to its superior performance on unseen test data.
